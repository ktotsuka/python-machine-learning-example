  - Epoch
    - A pass over the training dataset
  - Standardization
    - Normalize the features by making them to have the mean of 0 and the standard deviation of 1
  - Hyperplane
    - Decision boundary
  - Regularization
    - A method for handling over-fitting.  It works by adding penalty for big weights.
  - Feature selection
    - Select features that are important and get rid of ones that are not to reduce the

  - Perceptron
    - A linear model for binary classification 
    - It uses correct/not correct to adjust weight
  - Adaline gradient descent
    - A linear model for binary classification 
    - It uses gradient to adjust weight
    - The weight is adjusted all at once per epoch
  - Stochastic gradient descent
    - Same as Adaline gradient descent, but it adjust the weight incrementally
- Chapter 3
  - Logistic regression
    - A linear model for binary classification 
  - Support vector machine
    - A linear model for binary classification 
    - Same as Perceptron, but it tries to maximize the margin (distance between the decision boundary and the training examples)
  - Decision tree

    - Ordinal
      - Categorical feature that can be ordered (ex: T-shirt size)
